## 🔑 Key Features

* **Automated File Renaming**
  Detects and renames ROMs and cover art (`.zip`, `.bin`, `.cue`, `.a26`, `.d64`, etc.) based on curated text lists.

* **Special Naming Conventions**

  * Converts Roman numerals → Arabic numerals
  * Retains disc numbers `(Disc 1), (Disc 2, …)`
  * Cleans up complex title structures

* **Duplicate Title Detection**
  Scripts scan for duplicates (multiple versions of the same game) and let you choose which to keep, ensuring a clean Wiiflow library without clutter.

* **Iterative Processing**
  Runs in loops to ensure all files are renamed correctly—no stragglers left behind.

* **Auto SD/USB Transfer**
  New scripts automatically copy files into the correct structure on your SD or USB device for Wiiflow.

## 📂 How It Works (depending on the system)

1. Place your ROMs in the system’s `games/` folder.
2. Place unzipped PNG cover art in the `cover art/` folder.
3. Run the script (`python tool.py`). (example)
4. Follow the prompts to rename, de-duplicate, organize, and (if wanted) transfer files to your SD/USB device.

Covers must **exactly match the ROM filename (including extension) + `.png`**, or Wiiflow won’t recognize them.

> Example: `SuperGame.zip` → `SuperGame.zip.png`

renamed cover art will be sent to the "renamed cover art" folder
renamed games will stay in the same folder
